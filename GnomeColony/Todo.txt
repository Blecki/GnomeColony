* Run AI on constant tick rate
	- The entire simulation now runs on a constant tick rate.
	- This has horribly broken gnome motion.

"Actor Actions" should not require access to the sim. How to reconcile this with the move action, which needs to follow the grid? 
	- Move action takes a set of points to move along and a time frame to do it in. It does NOT know about the grid.
	- 'Tick Time' - [0, 1] - time elapsed in current tick

* Block definition language
* "Fringe" blocks - hang below existing block, things like hanging vines, bottom of ramps, etc.
Non-solid blocks

* Refactor block tiles stuff in sim into a 'block set' type
	* - Needs to be a pervasive change to all things that use the block set.


* Need to find blocks by name, not using an enum.
Block definition loader needs to do a better job reporting errors.
Clean up thing where tasks are passed gnomes, and have an assigned gnome.

'Decal' objects - AKA, train tracks. Applied on surface of block.
